# Assumptions

I am going to do this as simply as possible, as you may not have covered cryptography yet!

I have carried out all the tasks in this walkthrough using my personal account. This is bad practice. On a production system, I would create a service account called provisioning and use this for all tasks associated with Ansible, at both the client and server.

To make it work seamlessly, the provisioning account must be able to sudo without a password. I cover how to configure this in my Linux SSH notes.
I am also using RSA keys, it would be better to use EC or ED, more on this in my security and Linux notes. 

# AnsibleManager
I need to install ssh server, if not already installed.
```
sudo apt install openssh-server -y
```
Next I need to generate some local keys for use with Ansible.
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/local.rsa -C john.oraw@hotmail.com
```
I need to copy the SSH IS from my AnsibleManager to each server.
```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/local.rsa.pub johnoraw@ansibleserver1
```
and
```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/local.rsa.pub johnoraw@ansibleserver2
```
Now to save you some time...to get the SSH agent to load into an SSH session requires some extra steps. To bypass this, we should only work from the colsole in the desktop. To test, try to login to both ansibleservers from the desktop only. You will not be asked for a password!
