# Desktop
I do updates on my gold images and then create the following VM as a linked clone.

| Type     | hostname        | 
| ------   | --------------- | 
| Desktop  | AnsibleManager  | 

I need to assign the following IP address to my node.

| hostname        | IPv4 address    |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| AnsibleManager  | 192.168.228.110 |


The gateway for this LAN is on 192.168.228.2 and I use 9.9.9.9 as an Internet DNS.

## Hostname
I edit __/etc/hostname__ to give each server the correct hostname.


## Host resolution
I edit __/etc/hosts__ as we do not have a local DNS (and we must be able to find the other nodes!). 

```
127.0.0.1 localhost
192.168.228.110 ansiblemanager
192.168.228.111 ansibleserver1
192.168.228.112 ansibleserver2
192.168.228.113 ansibleserver3

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters

```

Test the VMs by attempting an update and then ping from VM to VM using their hostnames.
